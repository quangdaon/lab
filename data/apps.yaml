  description: |
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffon%27s_needle_problem" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Buffon's Needle</a> is a mathematical question with a surprising solution. As it turns out, when you calculate the probability that a line segment of length N intersects a series of parallel lines spaced N units apart, pi makes a unexpected appearance. For Pi Day 2022, I used this fact in reverse to approximate the value of pi by simulating toothpicks being dropped onto evenly spaced lines.

  description: |
    Before modern computing, pi had to be calculated by hand. Archimedes did this by inscribing a polygon inside a unit circle and circumscribing one outside to find the lower and upper limits of what pi possibly can be. This is a visual demonstration of this method. Check out <a href="https://youtu.be/gMlf1ELvRzc?t=85" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Veritasium explanation</a> for more details.
